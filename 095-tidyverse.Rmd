In this chapter we will introduce a few tools from the **tidyverse** [@R-tidyverse] set of R-packages:

* the pipe operator `%>%` for chaining function calls in a convenient and readable way;
* the `tibble` class, a variant of the data frame that is especially suitable for large data sets;
* data manipulation functions from the **dplyr* package suitable for use with the pipe operator:
    * `filter()` and `select()` for sub-setting;
    * `mutate()` for transforming variables;
    * `group_by()` `summarise()` for numerical summaries of data.

## The Tidyverse {#tidyverse}

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


The **tidyverse** isn't a package, exactly---it's a collection of packages.  Go ahead and attach it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```
## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
## Loading tidyverse: tibble
## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
## Loading tidyverse: readr
## Loading tidyverse: purrr
## Loading tidyverse: dplyr
## Conflicts with tidy packages -----------------------
## filter(): dplyr, stats
## lag():    dplyr, stats
```

You get an account of the packages that have been attached.  We have worked before with **ggplot** and by the end of CSC 215 we will have worked with all of the others.  You need not worry about the fact that `filter()` and `lag()` mask functions from the **stats** package.

\newpage

## The Pipe Operator

The pipe operator looks like this:  `%>%`.  It comes from the **magrittr** package.^[**magrittr** is not attached in the tidy-verse, but most of the capability of this package is imported by **dplyr**.]

The piper operator connect two function calls by making the the value returned by the first call the first argument of the second call.  Here's an example:

```{r}
"hello" %>% rep(times = 4)
```
This is the same as the more familiar:

```{r}
rep("hello", times = 4)
```

Here's another example:

```{r}
# same as nrow(tigerstats::m111survey)
tigerstats::m111survey %>% nrow()
```

Here's two pipes:

```{r}
"hello" %>% rep(times = 4) %>% length()
```

By default the value of the left-hand call is piped into the right-hand call as the *first* argument.  You can make it some other argument by referring to it as the dot `.`, for example:

```{r}
4 %>% rep("hello", times = .)
```

Since sub-setting is actually a function call under the hood, you can use the dot there, too:

```{r}
# gets the third element of the sequence 1, 4, 9, ..., 97:
seq(1, 100, by = 4) %>% .[3]
```

The pipe operator isn't all that useful when you only use it once or twice in succession.  Its true value becomes apparent in the chaining together of many manipulations involving data frames.

### Practice Exercises

1. Rewrite the following call with the pipe operator, in three different ways:

    ```{r}
    seq(2, 22, by = 4)
    ```
    
2. Consider `mosaicData::CPS85`:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    data("CPS85", package = "mosaicData")
    ```

    Use the pipe operator with `subset()` to the row of `mosaicData::CPS85` containing the worker who made more than 40 dollars per hour.  Display only the sex, age and wage of the worker.  
    
### Solutions to the Practice Exercises

1. Here are three ways:

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    2 %>% seq(22, by = 4)
    22 %>% seq(2, ., by = 4)
    4 %>% seq(2, 22, by = .)
    ```
    
2.  Try this:

    ```{r}
    CPS85 %>% 
      subset(wage > 40) %>% 
      .[, c("sex", "age", "wage")]
    ```

\newpage

## Tibbles

The **tibble** package gives us tibbles, which are very nearly the same thing as a data frame.  Indeed, the name "tibble" is supposed to remind us of a data "table."

Consider the class of `tigerstats::m111survey`:

```{r}
class(tigerstats::m111survey)
```

Yep, it's a data frame.  But we can convert it to a tibble, as follows:

```{r}
survey <- as_tibble(tigerstats::m111survey)
class(survey)
```

You can treat tibbles like data frames.  For now the primary practical difference is manifest when you print a tibble to the Console:

```{r}
survey
```

The output is automatically truncated, and the number of columns printed is determined by the width of your screen.  This is a great convenience when one is dealing with larger data sets.

Many larger data tables in packages will come to you as tibbles.

\newpage


## Subsetting with dplyr

The **dplyr** function `filter()`\index{R-functions!filter()@\texttt{filter()}} is the rough equivalent of `select()`:  it picks out rows of a data frame (or similar objects such as a tibble).  The **dplyr** function `select()`\index{R-functions!select()@\texttt{select()}} subsets for columns.

Thus you can use the two functions together to do perform sub-setting.  With the pipe operator, your code can be quite easy to read:

```{r}
survey %>% 
  filter((sex == "male" & height > 70) | (sex =="female" & height < 55)) %>% 
  select(sex, height, fastest)
```

Note that **dplyr** data-functions like `filter()` and `select()` take a data table as their first argument, and return a data table as well.  Hence they may be chained together as we saw in the above example.

With `select()` it's easy to leave out columns, too:

```{r}
survey %>% 
  select(-ideal_ht, -love_first)
```

### Practice Exercises

1.  Can you use the pipe to chain **dplyr** functions along with `nrow()` to find out how many people in `survey` believe in love at first sight and drove more than 120 miles per hour?

2. Find the three largest heights of the males who drove more than 120 miles per hour.

3. Use the pipe and `filter()` to make violin plots of the wages of men and women in `CPS85`, where the outlier-person (whose wage was more than 40 dollars per hour) has been eliminated prior to making the graph.

### Solutions to Practice Exercises

1. Try this:

    ```{r}
    survey %>% 
      filter(love_first == "yes" & fastest > 120) %>% 
      nrow()
    ```

2.  Here's one way:

    ```{r}
    survey %>% 
      filter(sex == "male" & fastest > 120) %>%
      .$height %>%                 # this is just a vector
      sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%  # so you can sort it ... 
      .[1:3]                       # then get its first three elements
    ```

3.  Try this code:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    CPS85 %>% 
      filter(wage <= 40) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = wage)) +
        geom_violin(fill = "burlywood")
    ```

\newpage


## Transforming Variables with dplyr

In **dplyr** you transform variables with the function `mutate()`\index{R-functions!mutate()@\texttt{mutate()}}.  Here is an example:

```{r}
survey %>% 
  mutate(dareDevil = fastest > 125) %>%
  select(sex, fastest, dareDevil)
```

In `mutate()` there is always a variable-name on the left-hand side of the `=` sign.  It could be the same as an existing variable in the table if you are content to overwrite that variable.  On the right side of the `=` is a function that can depend on variables in the data table.

You can transform more than one variable in a single call to `mutate()`, as in the code below.  The output is shown in \@ref(fig:mutatefastest).

```{r mutatefastest, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Graph produced after mutation.", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  mutate(dareDevil = fastest > 125,
         speedKmHr = fastest * 1.60934) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dareDevil, y = GPA)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "burlywood", out.alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2)
```

### Practice Exercises

1. In `mosaicData::CPS85` transform the `wage` variable to units of dollars per day.  (Assume an 8-hour working day.)

### Solutions to Practice Exercises

1.  Try this:

    ```{r}
    CPS85 %>% 
      as_tibble() %>%                   # for display in Console
      mutate(dailyWage = wage * 8) %>% 
      select(sex, sector, dailyWage)    # for display in Console
    ```



## Grouping and Summaries

\index{R-functions!group\_by()@\texttt{group_by()}}
\index{R-functions!summarise()@\texttt{summarise()}}

The next two **dplyr** data-functions are useful for generating numerical summaries of data.

Consider, for example, `CPS85`.  We know from graphical studies that the men in the study are paid more than women, but how might we verify this fact numerically?  One approach would be to separate the men and the women into two different groups and compute the mean wage for each group.  This is accomplished by calling `group_by()` and `summarise()` in succession:

```{r}
CPS85 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(meanWage = mean(wage))
```

It's possible to create more than one summary variable in a single call to `summarise()`, for example:

```{r}
CPS85 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(meanWage = mean(wage),
            n = n())
```

In the previous example, `dplyr::n()` \index{R-functions!n()@\texttt{n()}}was used to count the number of cases in each group.

For a more complete account of a numerical variable, one might consider the *five-number summary*:

* the minimum value
* the first quartile (Q1)
* the median
* the third quartile (Q3)
* the maximum value

These quantities are conveniently computed by R's `fivenum()` \index{R-functions!fivenum()@\texttt{fivenum()}} function:

```{r}
CPS85 %>% 
  .$wage %>% 
  fivenum()
```

Let's find the five number summaries for the wages of men and women:

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            min = fivenum(wage)[1],
            Q1 = fivenum(wage)[2],
            median = fivenum(wage)[3],
            Q3 = fivenum(wage)[4],
            max = fivenum(wage)[5])
```

It's also possible to group by more than one variable at a time.  For example, suppose that we wish to compare the wages of men and women in the various sectors of employment.  All we need to do is group by both `sex` and `sector`:

```{r}
CPS85 %>% 
  group_by(sector, sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            min = fivenum(wage)[1],
            Q1 = fivenum(wage)[2],
            median = fivenum(wage)[3],
            Q3 = fivenum(wage)[4],
            max = fivenum(wage)[5])
```

Note that there were no women in the construction sector, so that group did not appear in the summary.

### Note on Binding

Keep in mind that you can always "save" the results of any computation by binding them to a variable name, thus:

```{r}
sexSector <-
  CPS85 %>% 
  group_by(sector, sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            min = fivenum(wage)[1],
            Q1 = fivenum(wage)[2],
            median = fivenum(wage)[3],
            Q3 = fivenum(wage)[4],
            max = fivenum(wage)[5])
class(sexSector)
```

Note that the result has `data.frame` as one of its classes, so you may extract components in any of the ways you have learned.  The old ways, for instance, are fine:

```{r}
# minimum wage among male professionals:
with(sexSector, min[sex == "M" & sector == "prof"])
```


### Practice Exercises

These exercises deal with flight data from the **nycflights13** data frame:

```{r eval = FALSE}
data("flights", package = "nycflights13")
```

1. The `flights` table gives information about each departure in the year 2013 from one of the three major airports near New York City:  John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA) or Newark (EWR).  The airport from which the plane departed is recorded in the variable `origin`.  The variable `dep_delay` gives the delay in departure, in minutes.  (This is a negative number if the plane left early).  Find the number of departures and the mean departure delay for each of the three airports.  (Note that `dep_delay` for cancelled flights will be `NA`.)

2. The variable `distance` gives the distance, in miles, between an origin and destination airport.  For July 26, 2013, make a violin plot of the distances traveled by the departing planes from the each of the three New York airports.  Use the pipe and `filter()` to take `flights` into the desired plot.

3.  Examine the plot you made in the previous problem:  two of the flights appear to be about 5000 miles.  Use the pipe, `filter()` and `select()` to display the origin, destination and distance for these two flights.


### Solutions to Practice Exercises

1. Flights that were cancelled have `NA` for their departure delay, so we need to filter out these cases first, in order to correctly count the number of flights that actually left the airport.  Try this:

    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
      group_by(origin) %>% 
      summarise(departures = n(),
                meanDelay = mean(dep_delay))
    ```

2. Try this:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    flights %>% 
      filter(month == 6 & day == 26) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = distance)) +
        geom_violin(fill = "burlywood") +
        geom_jitter(width = 0.25, size = 0.1)
    ```

3.  Try this:

    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      filter(month == 6 & day == 26 & distance > 4000) %>% 
      select(origin, dest, distance)
    ```

    runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
    ```
    
1.  Rewrite the following command using two pipe operators in succession:

    ```{r}

    ```
    >The next few exercises are about the `babynames` data frame from the **babynames** package [@R-babynames].

1. Find the names for females born in 2015 that were given to more than 1% of female applicants (i.e., `prop` is bigger than 0.01).

2. Use the pipe operator and **dplyr** functions to produce the following graph of the popularity of "Mary" and "Mia" as girl-names over the years.  Note that popularity is given as number per one thousand applicants, i.e., as `prop * 1000`.

    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    babynames %>%
      filter(sex == "F" & name %in% c("Mary", "Mia")) %>% 
      mutate(popularity = prop * 1000) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = year, y = popularity)) +
      geom_line(aes(color = name)) +
      labs(y = "number per 1000")
    ```
