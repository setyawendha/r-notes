In this chapter we will take a closer look at character-vectors, and in particular at character vectors of length one, which are commonly called "strings."  The ability to manipulate strings is the foundation for all text-processing in computer programming.

\newpage

## Character Vectors:  Strings
\index{string}

Computers work at least as much with text as they do with numbers.  In computer science the values that refer to text are called *strings*.

In R, as in most other programming languages, we use quotes as delimiters, meaning that they mark the beginning and the end of strings.  Recall that in R, strings are of type `character`.  For example:

```{r}
greeting <- "hello"
typeof(greeting)
```

Of course, a single string does not exist on its own in R.  Instead it exists as the only element of a character-vector of length 1.

```{r}
is.vector(greeting)
length(greeting)
```

To make strings we can use double quotes or single quotes.  Since the string-value does not include the quotes themselves but only what appears between them, it does not make any difference which type of quotes we use:

```{r}
greeting1 <- "hello"
greeting2 <- 'hello'
greeting1 == greeting2
```

When we make a character vector of length greater than one, we can even use both single and double quotes:

```{r}
politeWords <- c("Please?", 'Thank you!')
politeWords
```

Notice that when R prints `politeWords` to the console it uses double-quotes.  Indeed, double-quoting is the recommended and most common way to construct strings in R.

## Characters and Special Characters

Strings are made up of characters:  that's why R calls them "character vectors."  From your point of view as a speaker of the English language, characters would seem to be the things you would have entered on a typewriter, and which can be entered from your computer keyboard as well:

* the lower-case letters a-z;
* the upper case letters A-Z;
* the digits 0,1, ..., 9 (0-9);
* the punctuation characters:  ., -, ?, !, ;, :, etc. (and of course the comma, too!)
* a few other special-use characters:  ~, @, #, $, %, _, +, =, and so on;
* and the space, too!

All of the above can be part of a string.

But quote-marks (used in quotation and as apostrophes) can also be part of a string:

```
"Welcome", she said, "the coffee's on me!"
```

Since quote-marks are used to *delimit* strings but can also be part of them, designers of programming languages have to think carefully about how to manage quote-marks.  Here's how it works in R:

* If you choose to delimit a string with double-quotes, then you can put single-quotes anywhere you like within the string and they will be treated by the computer as literal single-quotes, not as string-delimiters.  Here is an example:

    ```{r}
    cat("'Hello', she said.")
    ```
    
* If you delimit with double-quotes and you want to place a double-quote in your string, then you have to *escape* that double-quote with the backslash character `\`:

    ```{r}
    cat("\"Hello\", she said.")
    ```
* If you choose to delimit a string with single-quotes, then you can put double-quotes anywhere you like within the string and they will be treated by the computer as literal double-quotes, not as string-delimiters.

    ```{r}
    cat('"Hello", she said.')
    ```
    
* If you delimit with single-quotes and you want to place a single-quote in your string, then you have to escape that single-quote:

    ```{r}
    cat('\'Hello\', she said.')
    ```
    
In R and in many other programming languages the backslash `\` permits the following character to "escape" any special meaning that is otherwise assigned to it by the language.  When we write `\"` we say that we are "escaping" the double-quote; more precisely, we are escaping the special role of the double-quote as a delimiter for strings.

Of course the foregoing implies that the backslash character has a special role in the language:  as an escaping-device.  So what can we do if we want a literal backslash in our string?  Well, we simply escape it by preceding it with a backslash:

```{r}
cat("up\\down")
```

Another example:

```{r}
cat("C:\\\\Inetpub\\\\vhosts\\\\example.com")
```

So much for "ordinary" characters.  But there are special characters, too, sometimes called *control* characters, that do not represent written symbols.  \index{control character}We have seen a couple of them already;  the newline character `\n` is one:

```{r eval = FALSE}
bye <- "Farewell!\n\n"
cat(bye)
```

```
## Farewell!  # first \n moves us to a new line ...
##            # .. which is empty due the next \n
```

We have also seen the tab-character `\t`:

```{r}
cat("First Name\tLast Name")
```


Notice that the backslash character is used here to allow the `n` and `t` to escape their customary roles as the letters "n" and `t` respectively.

If you ask R, (try `help(Quotes)`), you will learn that there are several control characters, including:

```{r control-characters, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
Character <- c("\\\\n", "\\\\r", "\\\\t", "\\\\b", "\\\\a", "\\\\f", "\\\\v")
Meaning <- c("newline", "carriage return", "tab", "backspace", "alert (bell)",
              "form feed", "vertical tab")
tab <- as.table(cbind(Character, Meaning))
row.names(tab) <- NULL
knitr::kable(tab, caption = "Some control characters.")
```

It is worth exploring their effects.  Here are a couple of examples^[Note that `cat("Hell\ao")` won't give you "Hello" with a bell-sound.  To hear a bell you have to work with a terminal on your own computer.   On Linux or Mac, type `echo -e "\a"` and you should hear a beep.]:

```{r}
cat("Hell\to")
cat("Hell\ro")
```

A number of other non-control characters can be generated with the backslash.  Unicode characters\index{Unicode characters}, for instance, are generated by `\u{nnnn}`, where the n's represent hexadecimal digits.  Try the following in your console, and see what you get:

```{r}
cat("\u{2603}")  # the Snowman
```

Or, for something zanier:

```{r}
cat("Hello\u{202e}there, Friend!")
```


## Basic String Operations

We now introduce a few basic operations for examining, splitting and combining strings.  Some of the functions we discuss come from the **stringr** package, which is installed along with the tidyverse but is not automatically attached.  Make sure you attach it when you work with strings:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(stringr)
```


### Is and As

Recall from Chapter \@ref(vectors) that `as.character()` \index{R-functions!is.character()@\texttt{is.character()}}coerces other data types into strings:

```{r}
as.character(3.14)
as.character(FALSE)
as.character(NULL)
```

Also, `is.character()` \index{R-functions!as.character()@\texttt{as.character()}}tests whether an object is character-vector:

```{r}
is.character(3.14)
```

### Number of Characters

How many characters are in the word "hello"?   Let's try:

```{r}
length("hello")
```

Oh, right, strings don't exist alone: `"hello"` is actually a character-vector of length 1.  Instead we should use the `str_sub()` \index{R-functions!str\_length()@\texttt{str\_length()}}function:

```{r}
str_length("hello")
```

### Substrings and Trimming

We can pull out pieces of a string with the `str_sub()` \index{R-functions!str\_sub()@\texttt{str\_sub()}}function:

```{r}
poppins <- "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
str_sub(poppins, start = 10, end = 20)
```

One can also use `substr()` to replace part of a string with some other string:

```{r}
str_sub(poppins, start = 10, end = 20) <- "ABCDEFGHIJK"
poppins
```

Don't forget: "vector-in, vector-out" usually applies:

```{r}
words <- c("Mary", "Poppins", "practically", "perfect")
str_length(words)
str_sub(words, 1, 3)
```


In practical data-analysis situations you'll often have to work with strings that include unexpected non-printed characters at the beginning or the end, especially if the string once occurred at the end of a line in a text file.  For example, consider:

```{r}
lastWord <- "farewell\r\n"
str_length(lastWord)
cat(lastWord)
```

From its display on the console, you might infer that `lastWord` consists of only the eight characters: f, a, r, e, w, e, l, and l.  (You can't see the carriage return followed by the newline.)  But `str_length()` clearly shows that it's got two characters after the final "l", even if you can't see them.

If you think your strings might contain unnecessary leading or trailing white-space, you can remove it with `str_trim()`: \index{R-functions!str\_trim()@\texttt{str\_trim()}}

```{r}
str_trim(lastWord)
```

### Changing Cases

You can make all of the letters in a string lowercase: \index{R-functions!str\_to\_lower()@\texttt{str\_to\_lower()}}

```{r}
str_to_lower("My name is Rhonda.")
```

You can make them all uppercase: \index{R-functions!str\_to\_upper()@\texttt{str\_to\_upper()}}

```{r}
str_to_upper("It makes me wanna holler!")
```


### Splitting Strings

Consider the following character vector that records several dates:

```{r}
dates <- c("3-14-1963", "04-01-1965", "12-2-1983")
```

You might want to print them out in some uniform way, using the full name of the month, perhaps.  Then you would need to gain access to the elements of each date separately, so that you could transform month-numbers to month-names.

`str_split()` will do the job for you: \index{R-functions!str\_split()@\texttt{str\_split()}}

```{r}
str_split(dates, pattern = "-")
```

The result is a list with one element for each date in `dates`.  Each element of the list is a character vector containing the elements---month-number, day-number and year---that were demarcated in the original strings by the hyphen `-`, the value given to the `pattern` parameter.

If we wish, we may now access the elements of the list and process them in any way we like.  We might report the months, for example:

```{r}
dates %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "-") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  .[c(1, 4, 7)] %>% 
  as.numeric() %>% 
  month.name[.]
```

(Note the use in the code above of the `months.name` \index{R-constants!months.name@\texttt{months.name}} constant provided by R.)

Sometimes it's handy to split a string word-by-word:

```{r}
"you have won the lottery" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = " ") %>% 
  unlist()
```

Of course splitting on the space would not have worked if some of the words had been separated by more than one space:

```{r}
"you have won the  lottery" %>% # two spaces betwen 'the' and 'lottery'
  str_split(pattern = " ") %>% 
  unlist()
```

We'll address this problem soon.

In order to split a string into its constituent characters, split on the string with no characters:

```{r}
"aardvark" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "") %>% 
  unlist()
```

This would be useful if you wanted to, say, count the number of occurrences of "a" in a word:

```{r}
"aardvark" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  .[. == "a"] %>% 
  length()
```


### Pasting and Joining Strings

We are already familiar with `paste()`, which allows us to paste together the arguments that are passed to it:

```{r}
paste("Mary", "Poppins")
```

By default `paste()` separates the input strings with a space, but you can control this with the `sep` parameter:

```{r}
paste("Mary", "Poppins", sep = ":")
paste("Yabba","dabba","doo!", sep = "")
```

If you want the separator to be the empty string by default, then you could use `paste0()`:

```{r}
paste0("Yabba","dabba","doo!")
```

The **stringr** version of `paste0()` is `str_c()`\index{R-functions!str\_c()@\texttt{str\_c()}}:

```{r}
str_c("Yabba","dabba","doo!")
```


What if you had a character-vector whose elements you wanted to paste together?  For example, consider:

```{r}
poppins <- c("practically", "perfect", "in",
             "every", "way")
```

Now suppose you want to paste the elements of `poppins` together into one string where the words are separated by spaces.  `str_c()` will do the job for you, if you use its `collapse` parameter:

```{r}
poppins %>% 
  str_c(collapse = " ")
```


We'll call this process *joining*. \index{joining strings}

In an atomic vector all of the elements have to be of the same data type (all character, all numerical, etc.).  What if you want to join objects of different types?  If there are only a few, feel free to type them in as separate arguments to `str_c()`:

```{r}
str_c("March", 14, 1963, sep = " ")
```

If the objects are many, then you could arrange for them appear as the elements of a list:

```{r}
list("Mary", 343, "Poppins", FALSE) %>% 
  str_c(collapse = " ")
```

Joining appears to be the opposite of splitting, but in R that's not quite so.  Suppose, for instance, that you have dates where the month, day and year are separated by hyphens and you want to replace the hyphens with forward slashes:

```
3-14-1963  # you have this
3/14/1963  # you want this
```

You could try this:

```{r}
"3-14-1963" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "-") %>% 
  str_c(collapse = "/")
```

That's not what we want.  We have to remember than the result of applying `str_split()` is a list:

```{r}
"3-14-1963" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "-")
```

We need to unlist prior to the join.  The correct procedure is:

```{r}
"3-14-1963" %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "-") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  str_c(collapse = "/")
```

Now all is well.  Soon, though, we'll learn a superior method for performing substitutions in strings.

## Formatted Printing

Quite often when we are printing out to the console we want each line to follow some uniform format.  This can be accomplished with the `sprintf()` \index{R-functions!sprintf()@\texttt{sprintf()}}function.^[You can think of `sprintf` as short for:  "formatted printing in S".  S was the forerunner to the R language.]  Lets begin with an example:

```{r}
first <- "Mary"
last <- "Poppins"
sprintf(fmt = "%10s%20s", first, last)
```

`sprintf()` builds a string from the strings `first` and `last` that were passed to it.  The `fmt` parameter is a string that encodes the *format* of the result.  In this example, the command comes down to:

* create a string of width 10, consisting of five spaces followed by the five characters of "Mary"
* create a string of width 20, consisting of 13 spaces followed by the seven characters of "Poppins"
* The preceding two strings are called *fields*.  We then join the above the fields, with nothing between them.

Here is the result, `cat`ed out:

```{r}
sprintf(fmt = "%10s%20s", first, last) %>% 
  cat()
```

The "s" in the the `fmt` argument is called a *conversion character*.  \index{conversion character}It tells `sprintf()` to expect a string. Each percent sign indicates the beginning of a new field.   For each field, the desired field-width should appear between the percent-sign and the conversion character for the field.

In the text above, the names are *right-justified*, meaning that they appear at the end of their respective fields.  If you want a field to be left-justified, insert a hyphen anywhere between the percent sign and the conversion character, like so:

```{r}
# left-justify both fields:
sprintf(fmt = "%-10s%-20s", first, last) %>% cat()
```

Other common conversion characters are:

* `d`:  an integer
* `f`:  a decimal number (default is 6 digits precision)
* `g`:  a decimal number where the default precision is determined by the number of significant figures in the given number

Here is another example:

```{r}
sprintf(fmt = "%-10s%-10d%-10f", "Mary", 1955, 3.2) %>% cat()
```

The following example is the same as above, except that we retain only the significant figures in the 3.2:

```{r}
sprintf(fmt = "%-10s%-10d%-10g", "Mary", 1955, 3.2) %>% cat()
```

When you are creating a field for a decimal number, you can specify both the total field-width and the precision together if you separate them with a `.`.   Thus, if you want the number 234.5647 to appear right-justified in a field of width 10, showing only the first three decimal places, then try:

```{r}
sprintf(fmt = "%-10s%-10d%-10.3f", "Mary", 1955, 234.5647) %>% 
  cat()
```

`sprintf()` comes in handy when you want your output to appear in nicely-aligned, tabular fashion.  Consider this example:

```{r}
# information for three people:
firstName <- c("Donald", "Gina", "Rohini")
lastName <- c("Duck", "Gentorious", "Lancaster")
age <- c(17, 19, 20)
gpa <- c(3.7, 3.9, 3.823)
for (i in 1:3) {
  sprintf("%-15s%-20s%-5d%-5.2f\n", 
          firstName[i], lastName[i], age[i], gpa[i]) %>% 
    cat()
}
```

Note the use of "\\n" in the `fmt` argument to ensure that the output appears on separate lines.

You could take advantage of vectorization to avoid the loop:

```{r}
sprintf("%-15s%-20s%5-d%-5.2f\n", 
        firstName, lastName, age, gpa) %>% 
  cat()
```

Well, that's not quite right:  the second and third lines begin with a space.  This happens because `cat()` separates its input with a space by default.  You can prevent this, however, with the `sep` parameter of `cat()`:

```{r}
sprintf("%-15s%-20s%-5d%-5.2f\n", 
        firstName, lastName, age, gpa) %>% 
  cat(sep = "")
```

1. Write a function called `revStr()` that reverses the characters of any string that it is given.  The function should take a single parameter:
    * `str`:  a character-vector of length 1 (a single string).
    
    Typical examples of use should look like this:
    
    ```{r}
    revStr(str = "goodbye")
    ```
    
    **Hint**:  Let's think about how to solve the reversal problem for a specific string, e.g.:
    
    ```{r}
    str <- "goodbye"
    ```
    
    First, we could turn the string into a list whose only element is the vector of the characters of the string, as follows:
    
    ```{r}
    splitString <- str_split(str, pattern = "")
    splitString
    ```
    
    This could be turned into just the desired vector with the `unlist()` function:
    
    ```{r}
    unlist(splitString)
    ```
    
    Next, recall that R has a function `rev()` that, when given a vector, returns a vector with the elements in reverse order:
    
    ```{r}
    rev(unlist(splitString))
    ```
    
    Finally, we would need to convert the reversed vector back into a single string.  You have learned a **stringr** function that will accomplish this.
    
    After you have solved the problem for the specific vector `str`, encapsulate your work into the function `revStr()`.
    
    
1. A string is said to be a *palindrome* if it is the same no matter whether it is spelled backwards or forwards.  Write a function called `palindromeStr()` that determines whether or not a given string is a palindrome.  The function should take a single parameter:
    * `str`:  a character-vector of length 1 (a single string).
    
    It should return `TRUE` if `str` is a palindrome, and return `FALSE` otherwise.  Typical example of use should look like this:
    
    ```{r}
    palindromeStr(str = "abba")
    palindromeStr("hello")
    ```
    
    **Hint**;  Again, you should begin by solving the problem on a specific vector, and only then encapulate your work into a function.  To solve the specific problem, you might use the function `revStr()` from the previous problem.  Another possibility is to use `rev()` along with the function `all()` that you met in Chapter 2.
    
1. Write a function called `subStrings()` that returns a vector of the substrings of a given string that have at least a given number of characters.  The function should take two arguments:
    * `str`:  a character-vector of length 1 (a single string);
    * `n`: the minimum number of characters a substring should have in order to be included in the vector.
    
    Validate the input:  if the argument for `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of characters in `str`, then the function should advise the user and cease execution.  Typical examples of use should look like this (although it is OK if your output-vector contains the sub-strings in a different order):
    
    ```{r}
    subStrings("hello", 3)
    subStrings("hello", 6)
    ```
    
    **Hint**:  Begin by writing a function, called perhaps `subStringFixed()`, that when given a string and a specific number $n$, returns all of the substrongs of length exactly $n$.  It might work like this:
    
    ```{r}
    subStringFixed(str = "yabbadabbadoo!", n = 6)
    subStringFixed(str = "yabbadabbadoo!", n = 0)
    ```
    
2.  Write a function called `subPalindrome()` that, for any given string and specified number $n$, returns a character vector of all the substrings of the string having at least $n$ characters that are also palindromes.  The function should take two arguments:
    * `str`:  a character-vector of length 1 (a single string);
    * `n`: the minimum number of characters a substring should have in order to be included in the vector.
    
    Validate the input:  if the argument for `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of characters in `str`, then the function should advise the user and cease execution.  Typical examples of use should look like this (although it is OK if your output-vector contains the palindromes in a different order):
    
    ```{r}
    ## Note that palindrome substrings are repeated as many times
    ## as they occur in the given string:
    subPalindrome("yabbadabbadoo!", 2)
    subPalindrome("yabbadabbadoo!", 10)
    subPalindrome("yabbadabbadoo!", 0)
    ```
    

    
    
1.  Write a function called `m111Report()` that performs formatted printing from the data frame `m111survey` in the **bcscr** package.  Given a vector of row numbers, the function will print out the sex, feeling about weight, and GPA of the corresponding individuals.  Thus each row in the printout will correspond to an individual in the study.  Each row will consist of three fields:
    * The first field is 10 characters wide, and contains either "male" or "female", followed by the appropriate number of spaces.
    * The first field is 15 characters wide, and contains either "underweight" or "about right" or "overweight", followed by the appropriate number of spaces.
    * The third field is 5 characters wide, and contains an appropriate number of spaces followed by the grade-point average showing only the first two decimal places.  This, if a person's GPA is recorded as 2.714 then the field will be " 2.71".  (Note that, with the space and the decimal point, the total number of characters is 5, as required.)
    
    A typical example of use is as follows:
